> [!NOTE]
> With iOS â‰¥15 the client certificate bug has been fixed. As of iOS 15, Safari authenticates WebSocket connections with client certificates by itself. The workaround from this repository is therefore no longer needed.  
Since this workaround only works on Ubuntu 18.04, which will reach end-of-life in mid-2023, this repository will no longer be updated. If you need a NGINX WebSocket proxy with client certificate authentication (without iOS workaround), see the fork of this repository: [dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate](https://github.com/dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate).


Docker Image with nginx and configurable websocket proxy with SSL client certifcate authorization.  
This image includes a workaround for iOS Safari, as there is still an open bug that causes the SSL client certificate not being used for websocket connections, see [[1][1]] [[2][2]] [[3][3]].

I started to build this image to proxy Mosquitto MQTT websockets, but it will work with every websocket connection. 

# Usage

## As baseimage for your own project

Use this Image as baseimage for your own projects that need SSL Client Certificates on iOS devices:

```Dockerfile
FROM dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate-ios-workaround:3

COPY www /www

ENV WS_PROXY_PATH="/my-websocket-location"
ENV DEDICATED_COOKIE_LOCATION="/my-cookie-location"
ENV HMAC_SECRET="some-secret"
ENV WHITELIST_LOCAL_IP="false"
ENV WHITELIST_IP="10.1.1.0/24 192.168.1.0/24"
```

See next section for more options.

## Directly

This image can proxy-pass the Websocket connections, by setting the env variable `WS_PROXY`. The target path for the proxy can be configured with `WS_PROXY_PATH`, it defaults to `/ws`.

    docker run -d --restart=always \
        -v $(pwd)/www:/www:ro \
        -e "WS_PROXY=10.1.1.50:9001" \
        -p 80:80 \
        dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate-ios-workaround

If you provide an SSL key/cert pair in `/ssl`, the Docker Image will also enable HTTPS:

* `/ssl/nginx.key`
* `/ssl/nginx.crt`

Additionally you can enable client-authentification via SSL certificates, by providing:

* `/ssl/client.crt`

In case you have revoked clients, also prodive a `/ssl/client.crl` file.

A nice tutorial on how to generate your own certificates, is located [here](https://jamielinux.com/docs/openssl-certificate-authority/introduction.html).

    docker run -d --restart=always \
        -v $(pwd)/www:/www:ro \
        -v $(pwd)/ssl:/ssl:ro \
        -e "WS_PROXY=10.1.1.50:9001" \
        -p 80:80 \
        -p 443:443 \
        dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate-ios-workaround

If you want to change the default ports, specify it like this: `-p 8001:80 -p 8443:443 -e "HTTPS_REDIRECT_PORT=8443"`.

HTTPS and client-auth are optional for clients connecting from a local IP, according to [these](https://github.com/dersimn/nginx-websocket-proxy-client-certificate-ios-workaround/blob/3d8123b9830f49b9c1b3ef9176ef6c8fe22353dd/nginx.template#L90) IP ranges. If you don't want this behaviour, set `-e WHITELIST_LOCAL_IP=false` to force SSL and client-auth for everyone. You can also add own IP ranges to the whitelist with `-e WHITELIST_IP="10.1.1.0/24 192.168.1.0/24"`.


## iOS Client Certificate Workaround

The workaround is based on a [Keyed-Hash Message Authentication Code (HMAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC) and was initially described by [Chris Mullins](https://github.com/sidoh) for [Securing HomeAssistant with client certificates (works with Safari/iOS)][1]. 

By connecting to `/` a cookie will be generated that is used to authenticate the websocket connection later, as there is an open bug that iOS Safari is not using the client certificate for authenticating websocket conenctions [[3][3]]. It is also possible to use a dedicated cookie location to generate the previously mentioned cookie, by setting `-e DEDICATED_COOKIE_LOCATION="/cookie"`. However this requires your application to fetch the cookie prior to connecting to the websocket location, see an example [here](https://github.com/dersimn/mqtt-smarthome-webui/blob/9d74c4d5370c2e2249f8941abe35e0323d6bc4c8/www/webui.js#L60). 

The HMAC secret can be customized by `-e HMAC_SECRET="some_secret"`.
